# walshadow plan index

Component docs for walshadow's current implementation state. Start at
[overview.md](overview.md) for system shape, then drop into individual
components. Future-work proposals live under [future/](future/INDEX.md).
Cross-doc terminology is collected in [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md)

## Components

- [overview.md](overview.md) — system shape, supported PG versions,
  filter contract, ordering invariants, acceptance gates
- [filter.md](filter.md) — WAL filter, CRC rewrite, catalog tracker,
  rmgr-level keep/drop, NOOP-over-fork rationale
- [source.md](source.md) — START_REPLICATION PHYSICAL pump,
  `WalStream`, `StreamingWalker`, fan-out sinks, `QueueingRecordSink`,
  `DecoderSink`, walshadow walsender server
- [shadow.md](shadow.md) — shadow PG lifecycle, `ShadowCatalog` async
  libpq cache, `RelDescriptor`, `SchemaEvent` channel, reconnect
  resilience
- [decoder.md](decoder.md) — heap-tuple decoder, Tier 1/2 codec
  matrix, FPI decompression, `main_data` parsers, `pg_class_decoder`,
  read-time defaults
- [xact.md](xact.md) — `XactBuffer`, `SubxactTracker`, TOAST
  reassembly, local-disk spill + body spool, `DrainEntry` ordering
- [TOAST.md](TOAST.md) — TID-keyed `pg_toast_<relid>` CH mirror
  (`disabled`/`clickhouse`), delete tombstones + RMT-merge reclaim,
  as-of fetch, superseded-fill miss policy, bootstrap tap +
  defer-resolve; deferred R1 JOIN mode, streaming reassembly
- [emitter.md](emitter.md) — parallel decode+insert pipeline
  (reorder → decode ×M → batcher → inserter ×N → ack watermark),
  memory budget, `type_bridge`, synthetic columns, `DdlApplicator`,
  barrier fence
- [bootstrap.md](bootstrap.md) — greenfield BASE_BACKUP, `BackupSource`
  / `BackupSink` traits, `MultiplexSink`, `PageWalkSink` 2A decoder,
  shared insert tail
- [ops.md](ops.md) — preflight, metrics, retention, manifest (floor,
  6 LSNs), standby-status triple, kill-restart drill
- [oracle.md](oracle.md) — differential decode oracle, walshadow PG
  extension, `--validate` sampling
- [clickhouse-c-rs Safety model](../clickhouse-c-rs/README.md#safety-model)
  — FFI trust boundary, `Client<'fd>` lifetime shape, `PosixIo`
  `BorrowedFd` discipline, packet-payload union

## Future work

[future/INDEX.md](future/INDEX.md) collects design docs for unbuilt work:
runtime-config signals and net-new knobs, two-phase commit,
sequence-state replication, cross-table ordering, CH-bounce recovery,
parked operational polish. Promote built behavior into `plans/`

## Architecture diagrams

Live under [architecture/](../architecture/README.md). System-level
SVGs cover overview, internals, shadow communication, bootstrap
timeline, streaming timeline, restart timelines. Component SVGs cover
filter, source, shadow, decoder, xact, TOAST, emitter, bootstrap, ops,
and oracle. Updated on architecturally load-bearing changes

## Regenerating diagrams

Each `architecture/<comp>.dot` carries its own regeneration spec as a
header comment (sources of truth, subsumed plan section, quality bar);
shared style invariants live in [`architecture/palette.md`](../architecture/palette.md).
Workflow in [`architecture/README.md`](../architecture/README.md#regenerating-a-diagram).
Use when regenerating a component diagram after material code change
